                          From “The World Top 10 Nations GDP” chart, overall, we can see United State has the highest GDP over the world, 
                          the second one is China and the third one is Russia. 
                          In addition, the column chart shows us that Chinese GDP growed a lot from 2012 to 2018. 
                          However, it also shows us that U.S. and China GDP increase year by year. Other countries’ GDP went up and down. 
                          Especially Russia, it has the highest GDP in 2012 and then it decreased until 2016. 
                          Similar as United Kingdom, GDP decrease dramatically in 2015. Even though the GDP of UK increase after 2016, 
                          but it didn’t exceed 2013. I believe Brexit is one of the main reasons that UK’s GDP isn’t that great.

                        The education data set is missing United Kingdom and Canada; therefore, 
                        we are not going to compare these two countries’ education data with their GDP. </br>
                        The first section (overall GDP Comparison) points out U.S and China has the highest GDP over the world, 
                        but China has the lowest GDP per person in these 10 countries. The main reason is because China has the 
                        highest population over the world. When the high GDP allocate to each person, the amount will be very small. 
                        Australia is opposite with China. </br>
                        From the education per person chart we can see that U.S. has the highest expenditure in these 10 countries. The expensive 
                        tuition and school miscellaneous fee is a burden to most of the family.
                        This data surprised me that China is top 3 and Australia rank almost last. 
                        The education fee in China such as tuition or textbook fee are acutally way cheapter than U.S. However, 
                        Australia has the highest GDP per person, but Australian doesn’t seen like to spend too much on education. According to the 
                       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/11/private-education-spending-in-australia-soars-ahead-of-other-countries" target="_blank"><strong> report</strong></a>, 
                       the private education spending is actually increasing.

                          It is very easy to visualize that U.S citizen spend the most on Healthcare in the 10 countries 
                          is because the <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2019/us-health-care-spending-highest-among-developed-countries.html" target="_blank"><strong>

                          higher hospital administration costs and higher prices for many medical services.</q>
                          This is actually opposite with China. The same treatment,
                          <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-china-healthcare/" target="_blank"><strong> China is way cheaper than U.S. expenditure</strong></a>.

                        U.S military expenditure is also the top 1 in the world. U.S. is currently the most developed countries compare to other countries. 
                        It should spend a lot of money on military, not to mention after several terrorist attacks. </br>
                        Japan, a country doesn’t have army but Self-Defense Forces, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-defence-budget/japans-military-seek-eighth-straight-annual-hike-in-defense-spending-idUSKCN1VK0D2" target="_blank"><strong>

                          The education growth rate is very impressive. In 2015, almost all countries cut off the education expenditure. 
                          But <a href="https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=JPN&treshold=10&topic=EO" target="_blank"><strong>

                        From healthcare growth rate we can see, U.S healthcare growth rate is kind of stable. 
                        However, U.K has the highest fluctuation. From 2015 to 2017, the healthcare growth rate increase about 53%. 
                        Also, 2015 healthcare of most of countries has negative growth rate.
